# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# Additional Tests

* In the "RSS Feeds" suite, add a test to make sure that the URL values in allFeeds
are actually URLs
* In the "The Menu" suite, add a test to make sure that the menu closes when
users select a feed from the menu.
* In the "New Feed Selection" suite, add a test to make sure the page header changes
when a new feed is selected.
